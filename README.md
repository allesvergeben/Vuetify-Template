# VuetifyTemplate

## Description
This is a Template for Vuetify. It is for experienced users, as well as for beginners.
Just use this as a Template, to save some time setting up **router**, **vuex**,  **themes** and **i18n**.
This all is implemented, as well as a language switcher and a Theme switcher. However, experienced users will 
probably not need the sample implementations. 

If you have some other useful things, that should be in here, feel free to make a feature request,
i will answer asap.
